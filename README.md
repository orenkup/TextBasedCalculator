# TextBasedCalculator

This is a text based calculator application

The input is a series of assignment expressions.

At the end of evaluating the series, the value of each variable is printed out.

In order to calculate, write ***calc*** as an input.

Example:

```
i = 0
j = ++ i
x = i++ + 5
y = 5 + 3 * 10
i += y
```
Output:
`(i=82,j=1,x=6,y=80)`
